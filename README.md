# Zombie Simulation Project

In this project I'm going to develop a Python simulation of zombie apocalypse. The simulation contains characters of two classes - humans and zombies - who fight each other in order to win the battle. When a human wins a fight he kills a zombie. In the other case human gets infected and becomes a zombie. More detailed description of the rules is to be created.
